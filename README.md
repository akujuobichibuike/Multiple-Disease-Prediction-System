# MULTIPLE DISEASE PREDICTION SYSTEM.

This is a personal project done by me Chibuike Victor Akujuobi and reviewed by my friends Teyira Peter Geo-Needam & Emmanuel Ugochukwu. This project was done to enable me strengthen my skills in data analysis, visualization and the usage of python libraries such as streamlit, sklearn, seaborn and matplotlib to gain more experience in Machine learning. This project implements a Multiple Disease Prediction System with individual components for predicting diabetes, heart disease, and breast cancer. It includes a Streamlit web application for easy interaction.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for predicting multiple diseases including diabetes, heart disease, and breast cancer. It leverages machine learning models to make predictions based on user input. The project is organized into separate components for each disease prediction.

## Live Demo

You can access the live demo of the Multiple Disease Prediction System through the following link:

[Live Demo](https://akujuobichibuike-multiple-disease-prediction-mdps-public-olzirz.streamlit.app/)

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `streamlit_app`: Contains the Streamlit web application code.
- `diabetes_prediction`: Code for diabetes prediction.
- `heart_disease_prediction`: Code for heart disease prediction.
- `breast_cancer_prediction`: Code for breast cancer prediction.

## Features

- Predicts multiple diseases: diabetes, heart disease, and breast cancer.
- User-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit.
- Detailed README files within each disease prediction component.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Streamlit

## How to Use

### Running the Streamlit App

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akujuobichibuike/Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `streamlit_app` directory:

   ```bash
   cd streamlit_app
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will start the web application locally, and you can access it in your web browser.

### Disease Prediction Components

Each disease prediction component (diabetes, heart disease, and breast cancer) has its own set of instructions for running and using the prediction models. Refer to the README files within these component directories for specific details.
