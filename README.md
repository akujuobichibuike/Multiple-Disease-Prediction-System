# MULTIPLE DISEASE PREDICTION SYSTEM.

This is a personal project done by me Chibuike Victor Akujuobi and reviewed by my friends Teyira Peter Geo-Needam & Emmanuel Ugochukwu. This project was done to enable me strengthen my skills in data analysis, visualization and the usage of python libraries such as streamlit, sklearn, seaborn and matplotlib to gain more experience in Machine learning.

In this project, I took on the role of a data scientist working for a health tech company, tasked to build machine learning web-app based on data provided to classify breast cancer of a patient and predict the following diseases:
 1. Heart Disease
 2. Diabetes
 3. Parkinsons Disease

The web-app was built using Streamlit an open-source Python framework for developing web apps for machine learning and data science problems and hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud. This project is specifically made for experts in the health industry such as Oncologists, Endocrinologists, Neurologists and Cardiologist as they have a better understanding of the data required to use this app.
